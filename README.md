ADDITIONAL FEATURES/CREATIVITY/USABILITY:

1) Red buttons become blue when you hover over them. The cursor changes
from an arrow to a hand.

2) When you hover over the buttons, a message appears informing the user what function will be performed.
This is especially useful as some users may not understand the difference between "Average" and "Mean".

3) Users can change the names of the activities and short names. (Ex: user can
  change "Activity 1" to "Quiz 1") This helps users keep track of which grades are for what activities.

4) An additional button, "Reset", has been created. It erases all data in the input fields and
Percentage column. It also resets the activity names and short names back to their default names.

5) If a user types a value that is not a number, a pop-up message appears warning the user and saying
that they need to enter numbers.

6) If one or both grade input fields are empty for an activity, NaN won't be shown in the Percentage column.

7) If the user hovers over a row in the table, that row is highlighted in a light gray colour.
This is for aesthetic appeal and helps user know which row they're on.
